# Quick Fix for Windows Build Issues

## The Problem
You were getting SQLite3 compilation errors because:
1. `sqlite3` package requires native compilation on Windows
2. Python 3.13 removed the `distutils` module that node-gyp needs
3. Visual Studio Build Tools compatibility issues

## The Solution
I've fixed this by switching to `better-sqlite3` which:
- Has prebuilt binaries for Windows
- Doesn't require Python distutils
- Is faster and more reliable
- Works better with Electron

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Pull the latest changes
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Step 2: Clean install
```powershell
# Delete old files
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules, package-lock.json -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Fresh install
npm install
```

### Step 3: Try building again
```powershell
npm run dist:win
```

## If You Still Have Issues

### Option A: Use the web version instead
```powershell
npm run dev:web
# Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

### Option B: Check your Python version
```powershell
python --version
# Should be 3.8-3.11, NOT 3.12 or 3.13
```

### Option C: Install Visual Studio Build Tools
1. Download Visual Studio Build Tools 2019
2. Select "C++ build tools" workload
3. Restart your terminal

## What Changed

1. **Database**: Switched from `sqlite3` to `better-sqlite3`
2. **API**: Database operations are now synchronous (faster)
3. **Build**: Added Windows-specific build configuration
4. **Scripts**: Added `dist:win`, `rebuild`, and `postinstall` scripts
5. **Fixed**: Removed missing notarize.js script reference
6. **Fixed**: Corrected electron.js main entry point configuration

## Files Updated
- `package.json` - New dependency and scripts
- `server/models/Database.js` - Rewritten for better-sqlite3
- `WINDOWS_BUILD.md` - Comprehensive Windows guide
- `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` - Updated troubleshooting

## Success Indicators
✅ `npm install` completes without errors
✅ `npm run build` works
✅ `npm run dist:win` creates installer in `dist/` folder
✅ Desktop app launches successfully

- Check `WINDOWS_BUILD.md` for detailed Windows instructions
- Check `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` for general troubleshooting
- Try the web version with `npm run dev:web` as a fallback
